### ABC Classification



ABC classification is a ranking system for identifying and grouping items in terms of how useful they are for achieving business goals.
The system requires grouping things into three categories:

A - extremely important

B - moderately important

C - relatively unimportant

ABC classification is associated with the 80/20 rule, a business metric that proposes 80% of the outcomes are determined by 20% of the inputs.  The goal of ABC classification is to provide a way for a business to identify that valuable 20% so that segment can be controlled most closely.  Once the A’s, B’s and C’s have been identified, each category can be handled in a different way, with more attention being devoted to category A, less to B, and even less to C.
